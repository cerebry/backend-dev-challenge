# Cerebry Coding Challenge
(Inspired by https://github.com/busbud/coding-challenge-backend-c)

## Requirements

Design a REST API endpoint that provides auto-complete suggestions for large cities.

- the endpoint is exposed at `/suggestions`
- the partial (or complete) search term is passed as a querystring parameter `q`
- the caller's location can optionally be supplied via querystring parameters `latitude` and `longitude` to help improve relative scores
- the endpoint returns a JSON response with an array of scored suggested matches
    - the suggestions are sorted by descending score
    - each suggestion has a score between 0 and 1 (inclusive) indicating confidence in the suggestion (1 is most confident)
    - each suggestion has a name which can be used to disambiguate between similarly named locations
    - each suggestion has a latitude and longitude

## Requirements

* The application should be written in Python and use the Django web framework
* End result should be deployed on AWS (it provides a free tiers you can use).

## Bonus

* We love test-driven development and we share the love with developers who apply it
* Try to design and implement your solution as you would do for real production code. Show us how you create clean, maintainable code that does awesome stuff. Build something that we'd be happy to contribute to. This is not a programming contest where dirty hacks win the game.
* Documentation and maintainability are a plus
* We donâ€™t want to know if you can do exactly as asked (or everybody would have the same result). We want to know what you bring to the table when working on a project, what is your secret sauce. More features? Best solution? Thinking outside the box?

## Benefits

* Doing well in this challenge and receiving an offer from Cerebry entitles you to a **guaranteed 200$ bonus** from Cerebry after the first month.
* Good performance in this challenge positively impacts your offer. We like to reward folks who have demonstrated their skills even before they join us.


#### Sample responses

These responses are meant to provide guidance. The exact values can vary based on the data source and scoring algorithm

**Near match**

    GET /suggestions?q=Londo&latitude=43.70011&longitude=-79.4163

```json
